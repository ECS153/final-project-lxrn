# ECS 153 Final Project Proposal

## Team: S20-lxrn

Our project for this quarter aims to address the prevalent issue of private, encrypted conversation between private parties. In modern society, this is an important issue because leaked information and metadata volunteer lots of information that people don't mean to volunteer, and that information can be used for lots of purposes ranging from targetted marketing to [federal investigation](https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/05/ex-nsa-chief-we-kill-people-based-on-metadata). In order to solve this problem, we will build a messaging client with the idea that individuals can use to communicate while limiting the amount of private information being broadcasted to the rest of the internet. The first design iteration is based off the idea of dead-drops, with the messaging server as the 'neutral' ground, aiming to limit the amount of information provided about which clients are communicating. We expect that this will solve the problem by successfully allowing messages to be sent between parties, private from third parties, through a functional design of the application described above.
